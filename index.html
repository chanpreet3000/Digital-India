                        <p style="font-size:160%;">If you ask a group of people what ‘Digital India’ means to them, it
                            is really interesting to see the variety of
                            responses you get. For some, it is about Indian tech startups—Zomato, Ola, Urban Company,
                            etc, that are redefining
                            how we consume goods or services; for some it’s the legendary tech services companies—TCS,
                            Infosys and the like that have built
                            India’s mammoth $200 billion tech sector; for many, it is the power of social media and how
                            it’s giving every Indian a voice;
                            and for others, it is the increasing ease of use as more and more services, including
                            government facilities, go online—UPI payments,
                            Direct Benefit Transfers through Aadhaar, CoWin for vaccination, etc.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size:250%;">Journey and Transformations</h4>
                            <p style=" font-size : 160%;">It’s the 75th year of India’s independence, and as I sit back
                                to reflect on what is Digital India
                                and what is unique in this journey, for me it is the transformation of lives and
                                livelihoods that we are seeing at the grassroots,
                                powered by technology and the ingenuity of India’s innovation ecosystem. And enabling
                                the same is a quiet revolution that is at the heart of India’s
                                transformation into Digital India—India’s ‘platformization’ story, that is, how the
                                country has built one of the world’s most robust and comprehensive
                                digital public-good platforms as the foundation of Digital India.</p>
