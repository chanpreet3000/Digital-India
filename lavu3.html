<h2 style="font-size:250%;"> Digital platforms in Covid crisis </h2>

<p style="font-size:160%;">Digital platforms have also played a key role in India’s response 
to the covid crisis. Think of the MyGov Chatbot, which has provided validated information on 
key resources, or eSanjeevani, which has so far enabled 9 million telemedicine consultations, 
or CoWin, our vaccination gateway that has logged over 500 million vaccine doses.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:250%;">Importance and Unique for India </h3>

<p style="font-size:160%;"> First is the design principles: Affordability through low-cost development, 
interoperability with an API-driven backend, and the driving of large-scale reach. Secondly, access 
infrastructure: Mobile-first suitability even for the country’s non-smartphone segment, multi-lingual 
interfaces, and, most importantly, the leveraging of offline infrastructure of Common Service Centres 
in remote areas. Lastly, it is about innovation, enabling entrepreneurs to leverage these platforms and 
create truly unique solutions for India’s opportunities and challenges.</p>
