<h2 style="font-size:250%;">Potential to Unlock Opportunities </h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Open digital ecosystems today have the potential to unlock opportunities worth $700 billion 
for India by 2030, as per a report by BCG. The environmental, societal and governance (ECG) impact across sectors like 
healthcare, talent, urban governance, agriculture, law and justice, education and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) 
can create new value of $500 billion-plus, and over $200 billion in savings for the country.From enabling farmers to sell their 
produce through e-commerce platforms, to facilitating education and healthcare in the remotest parts of our nation, digitalization 
offers enormous transformative opportunities for India.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:250%;">Digital Advantage</h3>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The country must build on its digital advantage and pivot towards a more data-driven 
structure of governance. These platforms have laid a strong foundation for India to attain digital maturity.
 For many years, the country was known as the world’s “back office". That is rapidly changing, with the Indian 
tech industry pivoting to become the world’s digital solutions partner. In my view, the triage of digital tech solutions, 
digital talent and digital platforms at scale constitute Digital India.The next few years will be decisive for India’s potential 
to stimulate employment and get back to being one of the world’s fasting-growing large economies. As we say at Nasscom, when the world thinks 
‘digital’, the world must think India.</p>
