                    <h1 style="font-size : 250%;">Impact on our lives</h1>
                    <p style=" font-size : 160%;">They say that good technology is invisible. India’s platformization
                        strategy
                        has quietly begun to impact each and every one of our lives: for instance, each time we use the
                        UPI (Unified Payments Interface)
                        to make a payment, or book a vaccination slot using CoWin, or use Aadhaar to access a service.
                        It is the highway on which Digital India runs.
                        And with over 20 platforms impacting over a billion lives, India is truly leading the world on
                        building the substratum for a strong and scalable digital economy.</p>
                    <h2 style="font-size : 250%;">Seamless Transactions</h2>
                    <p style=" font-size : 160%;">The rise of public digital platforms also represents a productive
                        engagement between the government and Indian industry
                        to work together in tackling crucial socio-economic challenges.Aadhaar has been India’s most
                        visible digital platform.The state-run Bhim UPI app clocked
                        over 3.2 billion transactions in July 2021, marking a game-changing penetration of digital
                        payments in India. FastTag, which became mandatory earlier
                        this year and enables online toll collection, has already facilitated 192 million transactions.
                        The Umang app, which offers a one-stop platform for
                        multiple government services, has witnessed a cumulative 1.7 billion transactions.</p>
